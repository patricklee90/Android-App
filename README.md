# Android-App

Hi there, this is my first repository for mobile app applications. 

You may realize there is one folder (so far only one). Yeah, you are right, that is one folder per project.

In the future, I will continue to update this repository if there is any new project I learned.

You may check the definition for each folder here:

1.  Coursera - Build Your First Mobile Application 

- It is a Coursera course : [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-app/)
